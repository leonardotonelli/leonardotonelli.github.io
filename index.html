          <h1>Hey! I'm Leonardo Tonelli</h1>
          <p> I am a student at Bocconi University in Milan, studying Economics, Management and Computer Science. I come from Avezzano a little city in central Italy, in the Abruzzo region.
          During my studies I became passionate about statistics and machine learning, facinated by its impact across multiple disciplines. I aspire to be a researcher / data scientist in industry or academia. 
          Currently focused on building experience and expanding my knowledge, driven by curiosity and a desire to make an impact within my current abilities.</p>
